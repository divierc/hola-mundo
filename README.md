    What is GitHub?
    Create a Repository
    Create a Branch
    Make a Commit
    Open a Pull Request
    Merge Pull Request

The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!

You’ll learn how to:

    Create and use a repository
    Start and manage a new branch
    Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
    Open and merge a pull request

What is GitHub?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
No coding necessary

To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub.com account and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).

    Tip: Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.

Step 1. Create a Repository

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.

Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
To create a new repository

    In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click 

    and then select New repository.
    Name your repository hello-world.
    Write a short description.
    Select Initialize this repository with a README.

Click Create repository.

Step 2. Create a Branch

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This diagram shows:

    The master branch
    A new branch called feature (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)
    The journey that feature takes before it’s merged into master

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:

    story.txt
    story-joe-edit.txt
    story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt

Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.

Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master.
To create a new branch

    Go to your new repository hello-world.
    Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
    Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
    Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

Now you have two branches, master and readme-edits. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.

Step 3. Make and commit changes

Bravo! Now, you’re on the code view for your readme-edits branch, which is a copy of master. Let’s make some edits.
